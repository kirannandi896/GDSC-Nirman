      <h2>Safety and Control Measures During Floods:</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>A] Before a Flood:</h3>
      <br><br>
  <ul>
       <li><b> Stay informed:</b> Monitor weather reports and listen to local authorities for flood warnings and instructions.</li>
    <br>
      <li><b>Prepare your home:</b>
        <br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Elevate important belongings and furniture to higher levels.</li>
          <li>Seal basements and crawlspaces to prevent water intrusion.</li>
          <li>Install check valves in sewer drains to prevent backflow.</li>
          <li>Sandbag low-lying doorways and openings.</li>
          <li>Prepare an emergency kit with essentials like food, water, first-aid supplies, medications, flashlight, and battery-powered radio.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    <br>
      <li><b>Develop an evacuation plan:</b>
        <br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Identify evacuation routes and designated shelters.</li>
          <li>Practice your evacuation plan with your family, including pets, and agree on a meeting location in case you get separated.</li>
        </ul>
  </ul>
      <br><br>
      <h3>B] During a Flood:</h3>
      <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Evacuate immediately if instructed to do so by authorities or if your home is in danger of flooding.</li>
      <li><b>Do not drive through flooded areas:</b> Six inches of moving water can knock you off your feet. Use designated evacuation routes and shelters.</li>
      <li><b>Stay away from power lines and electrical equipment:</b> Floodwater can conduct electricity, posing a serious danger.</li>
      <li>Turn off utilities at the main switch if you evacuate and only if it is safe to do so.</li>
      <li><b>Stay on higher ground:</b> If you cannot evacuate, move to upper floors or the roof and wait for rescue.</li>
    </ul>
      <br><br>
      <h3>C] After a Flood:</h3>
      <br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Wait for the water to recede completely before returning home.</li>
        <li><b>Be cautious of damaged structures:</b> Buildings and foundations may be weakened by floodwaters.</li>
        <li><b>Beware of electrical hazards:</b> Do not touch electrical equipment until it has been inspected by a qualified professional.</li>
      <li> <b>Report broken gas lines:</b> Do not attempt to turn off the gas yourself.</li>
        <li><b>Document the damage:</b> Take pictures and videos of the damage for insurance purposes.</li>
        <li><b>Contact your insurance company:</b> File a claim to start the recovery process.</li>
        <li><b>Be aware of potential health risks:</b> Floodwater can be contaminated with sewage and other pollutants. Wear protective clothing and boots when cleaning up and avoid contact with floodwater.</li>
      </ul>
      <br><br>
      <h3>D] Additional Control Measures:</h3>
      <br><br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Community-level measures:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Implement flood control measures like levees, flood walls, and channel improvements.</li>
            <li>Maintain drainage systems and clear debris from waterways.</li>
            <li>Promote sustainable land management practices to reduce soil erosion and runoff.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
      <li><b>Individual preparedness:</b>
      Purchase flood insurance, especially if you live in a flood-prone area.
      Consider waterproofing your basement or crawlspace.
      Install flood detection and alarm systems.
