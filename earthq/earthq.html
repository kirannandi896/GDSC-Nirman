      <h2>Before an Earthquake</h2>
      <ul class="checklist">
          <li><b>Create a Home Earthquake Plan:</b> Discuss earthquake safety procedures with your family and practice dropping, covering, and holding on.</li>
          <li><b>Secure Heavy Objects:</b> Anchor furniture, bookcases, and other heavy objects to walls to prevent them from falling.</li>
          <li><b>Assemble an Emergency Kit:</b> Prepare a kit with essentials like food, water, first-aid supplies, flashlight, and radio.  Consider including a whistle to signal for help and a dust mask for dust after the earthquake.</li>
          <li><b>Identify Safe Zones:</b> Locate safe areas under sturdy furniture or doorways away from windows and hanging objects.</li>
          <li><b>Learn to Shut Off Utilities:</b> Know how to turn off gas, water, and electricity in case of damage.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>During an Earthquake</h2>
      <ul class="checklist">
          <li><b>Drop, Cover, and Hold On:</b> If you feel the ground shaking, drop to the ground immediately, take cover under a sturdy object, and hold on until the shaking stops.</li>
          <li><b>Stay Indoors:</b> If you are indoors, stay inside and stay away from windows and outside walls.</li>
          <li><b>Move Away from Furniture:</b> If you are unable to get under something sturdy, move away from furniture that could fall on you.</li>
          <li><b>Do Not Use Elevators:</b> Take stairs if possible, elevators may not function during or after an earthquake.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>After an Earthquake</h2>
      <ul class="checklist">
          <li><b>Check for Injuries:</b> Attend to yourself and others who may be injured.</li>
          <li><b>Be Aware of Aftershocks:</b> Expect aftershocks, which can be smaller earthquakes that follow the main quake.</li>
          <li><b>Listen to Authorities:</b> Follow instructions from emergency personnel and stay informed about the situation.</li>
          <li><b>Check for Damage:</b> Assess the damage to your home and surroundings. Do not enter a building if you are unsure of the damage.</li>
          <li><b>Call for Help:</b> If you are in a building, call for help immediately.</li>
      </ul>
